  After years of testing, Disney World launched its innovative MyMagicPlus programme in 2013. Now, each and every guest gets their own MagicBand wristband, which acts as identification, hotel room key, tickets, FastPasses, and even a credit card. Guests simply swipe the band at sensors located around the park to gain entry to attractions or pay for items, giving Disney a wealth of data on where its guests are, what they’re doing and what they may need. This data allows Disney to anticipate guests’ every need and deliver an incredible, personalised experience.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;"> The idea is to create a totally frictionless experience for visitors, for example, by letting visitors reserve their place for certain rides and attractions before they even leave home, so they don’t have to queue when they get there (hurrah!). Remember, long waiting times is one of the biggest challenges for any theme park – because, when you’re queueing in line, you aren’t spending money in the park’s shops or restaurants. So any progress in eliminating long lines is critical for both guests and the business.
